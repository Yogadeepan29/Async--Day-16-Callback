In this Repository, I have completed the Day 16 Async programming - Callback task

==> Task-1 ( CALL BACK HELL TASK )

I have built a web page, that displays a countdown from 10 to 1 and then displays Happy Independence Day on the screen  using HTML, DOM, CSS and Advanced Javascript.

    * Named functions have not been used.
    * A set interval function has not been used.
    * Recursion has not been used.
    * IFFEs & named functions have not been used.
    * Looping has not been used.
    * Used Callback hell to display the timer
